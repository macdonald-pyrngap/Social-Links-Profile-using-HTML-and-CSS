## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Inter)

### What I learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Structuring a simple layout using **Flexbox**
- Centering elements vertically and horizontally
- Creating reusable button styles
- Managing spacing and alignment for a clean UI
- Using `border-radius` and color contrast to improve visual hierarchy

This project also helped me gain confidence in writing clean and readable HTML and CSS without relying on frameworks.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve responsiveness for very large screens
- Add smooth hover and focus animations
- Practice accessibility features like better focus indicators
- Explore small JavaScript interactions for similar UI components
